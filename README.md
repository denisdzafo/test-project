## Project Development
```
I've started project development creating sections from top to bottom design, I didn't find any issues in the development phase, just in the PSD file, I couldn't export pictures from the seller's section. The difficult part for me only was placing images in the coffee section. The time needed for the project was around 8 hours and I didn't finish all part of test.
